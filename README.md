# solidity-verifier

This repository will eventually contain Solidity implementation of Nova proving system.

The idea is actually to gather required cryptographic building blocks (pasta curves, Poseidon, etc.), evaluate them and check that they work as expected via test vectors provided by "trusted" Rust implementations and finally come up with working Nova verifier that can be deployed to the Filecoin network.
